## General Information

- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

- Goal is to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
    Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    How well those variables describe the bike demands

- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 Season have a very significant impact, the dependent variable (cnt) i.e. total no of bike
               rentals varied across seasons with fall being high and spring being the least. Relatively spring is significantly impacted compared fall, summer and winter

- Conclusion 2 Weather situation has impact on bike rentals with clear weather being the most preferable
                and light snow being the least. 
- Conclusion 3 Year 2018 have less bike rentals than 2019, probably in one year bike rentals got more   
                publicity and its usage increased

- Conclusion 4 Yr, temp and light snow are the variables with high magnitude coefficients, and they are
                significantly contributing to the demand of shared bikes. These are followed by wind speed and spring
